abstract={Health care is one of the most exciting frontiers in data mining and machine learning. Successful adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) created an explosion in digital clinical data available for analysis, but progress in machine learning for healthcare research has been difficult to measure because of the absence of publicly available benchmark data sets. To address this problem, we propose four clinical prediction benchmarks using data derived from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling risk of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline, and phenotype classification. We propose strong linear and neural baselines for all four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training and data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural models.},

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Describe the state of Electronic Health Records
               (EHRs) in 1992 and their evolution by 2015 and where EHRs are
               expected to be in 25 years. Further to discuss the expectations
               for EHRs in 1992 and explore which of them were realized and
               what events accelerated or disrupted/derailed how EHRs evolved.
               METHODS: Literature search based on ``Electronic Health
               Record'', ``Medical Record'', and ``Medical Chart'' using
               Medline, Google, Wikipedia Medical, and Cochrane Libraries
               resulted in an initial review of 2,356 abstracts and other
               information in papers and books. Additional papers and books
               were identified through the review of references cited in the
               initial review. RESULTS: By 1992, hardware had become more
               affordable, powerful, and compact and the use of personal
               computers, local area networks, and the Internet provided faster
               and easier access to medical information. EHRs were initially
               developed and used at academic medical facilities but since most
               have been replaced by large vendor EHRs. While EHR use has
               increased and clinicians are being prepared to practice in an
               EHR-mediated world, technical issues have been overshadowed by
               procedural, professional, social, political, and especially
               ethical issues as well as the need for compliance with standards
               and information security. There have been enormous advancements
               that have taken place, but many of the early expectations for
               EHRs have not been realized and current EHRs still do not meet
               the needs of today's rapidly changing healthcare environment.
               CONCLUSION: The current use of EHRs initiated by new technology
               would have been hard to foresee. Current and new EHR technology
               will help to provide international standards for interoperable
               applications that use health, social, economic, behavioral, and
               environmental data to communicate, interpret, and act
               intelligently upon complex healthcare information to foster
               precision medicine and a learning health system.",

abstract = {Despite the recent developments in deep learning models, their applications in clinical decision-support systems have been very limited. Recent digitalisation of health records, however, has provided a great platform for the assessment of the usability of such techniques in healthcare. As a result, the field is starting to see a growing number of research papers that employ deep learning on electronic health records (EHR) for personalised prediction of risks and health trajectories. While this can be a promising trend, vast paper-to-paper variability (from data sources and models they use to the clinical questions they attempt to answer) have hampered the field’s ability to simply compare and contrast such models for a given application of interest. Thus, in this paper, we aim to provide a comparative review of the key deep learning architectures that have been applied to EHR data. Furthermore, we also aim to: (1) introduce and use one of the world’s largest and most complex linked primary care EHR datasets (i.e., Clinical Practice Research Datalink, or CPRD) as a new asset for training such data-hungry models; (2) provide a guideline for working with EHR data for deep learning; (3) share some of the best practices for assessing the “goodness” of deep-learning models in clinical risk prediction; (4) and propose future research ideas for making deep learning models more suitable for the EHR data. Our results highlight the difficulties of working with highly imbalanced datasets, and show that sequential deep learning architectures such as RNN may be more suitable to deal with the temporal nature of EHR.}

abstract={Laboratory data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) are often used in prediction models where estimation bias and model performance from missingness can be mitigated using imputation methods. We demonstrate the utility of imputation in two real-world EHR-derived cohorts of ischemic stroke from Geisinger and of heart failure from Sutter Health to: (1) characterize the patterns of missingness in laboratory variables; (2) simulate two missing mechanisms, arbitrary and monotone; (3) compare cross-sectional and multi-level multivariate missing imputation algorithms applied to laboratory data; (4) assess whether incorporation of latent information, derived from comorbidity data, can improve the performance of the algorithms. The latter was based on a case study of hemoglobin A1c under a univariate missing imputation framework. Overall, the pattern of missingness in EHR laboratory variables was not at random and was highly associated with patients' comorbidity data; and the multi-level imputation algorithm showed smaller imputation error than the cross-sectional method.},

abstract={Objectives In clinical practice, many prediction models cannot be used when predictor values are missing. We, therefore, propose and evaluate methods for real-time imputation. Study Design and Setting We describe (i) mean imputation (where missing values are replaced by the sample mean), (ii) joint modeling imputation (JMI, where we use a multivariate normal approximation to generate patient-specific imputations), and (iii) conditional modeling imputation (CMI, where a multivariable imputation model is derived for each predictor from a population). We compared these methods in a case study evaluating the root mean squared error (RMSE) and coverage of the 95{\%} confidence intervals (i.e., the proportion of confidence intervals that contain the true predictor value) of imputed predictor values. Results --RMSE was lowest when adopting JMI or CMI, although imputation of individual predictors did not always lead to substantial improvements as compared to mean imputation. JMI and CMI appeared particularly useful when the values of multiple predictors of the model were missing. Coverage reached the nominal level (i.e., 95{\%}) for both CMI and JMI. Conclusion Multiple imputations using either CMI or JMI is recommended when dealing with missing predictor values in real-time settings.},
